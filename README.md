# Prescribed-time Observer Examples

This repository includes some simulation examples for the prescribed-time extended state observer (PESO) and prescribed-time disturbance rejection control (PDRC) applied to several systems. The files are uploaded as RAR archives of MATLAB codes and Simulink models. 

## Files:

1- State estimation of an unknown 2nd-order system with unknown order using PESO: PESO_ex1.rar

2- Tracking control of an unknown 4th-order system using PESO and PDRC: PESO_ex2.rar
